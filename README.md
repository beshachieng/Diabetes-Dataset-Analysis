# Data Cleaning and Machine Learning (Decision Tree) Project
## About the Dataset
This [dataset](./diabetes.csv) is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females who are at least 21 years old and of Pima Indian heritage.

The data set is made up on nine columns which include:

1. Pregnancies - Number of times pregnant

2. Glucose - The blood plasma glucose concentration after a 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test (mg/dL)

3. BloodPressure - Diastolic blood pressure (mm/Hg)

4. SKinThickness - Skin fold thickness measured by a Triceps Skinfold (mm)

5. Insulin - 2-hour blood serum insulin test (mu U/ml)

6. BMI - Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction - A function that determines the risk of type 2 diabetes based on family history. The larger the function, the higher the risk of type 2 diabetes.

8. Age - Women of 21 years and above.

9. Outcome - Whether the person is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (1 = yes, 0 = no)
